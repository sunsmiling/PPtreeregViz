Description: It was developed as a tools for exploring 'PPTreereg' (Projection Pursuit TREE of REGression). 
  It uses various projection pursuit indexes and 'XAI' (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) methods to help understand 
  the model by finding connections between the input variables and outputs of model. The 'KernelSHAP' calculation algorithm
  from Aas, Jullum and Løland (2019) <arXiv:1903.10464> was modified to fit this model, 
  and some codes has been modified from the 'shapr' package created by Sellereite, Nikolai, and Martin Jullum (2020) <doi:10.21105/joss.02027>.
  The implemented methods help to explore the model at the single instance level as well as at the whole dataset level.
  It can be compared with other machine learning models by applying it to the 'DALEX' package of 'R'.
